        description: "In adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics. In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms. In adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related spasticity, short-term use of oral cannabinoids improves patient-reported spasticity symptoms. For these conditions the effects of cannabinoids are modest; for all other conditions evaluated there is inadequate information to assess their effects.",
