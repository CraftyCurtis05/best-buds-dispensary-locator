                <h2>Coping Tips:</h2>
                <p>Consuming too much cannabis is rarely a medical emergency, despite how uncomfortable you may feel. 
                    Symptoms will subside as the effects wear off. In the meantime, these tips can help things feel more manageable:</p>   
                <ul class="list">
                    <h3>Remember that it will pass</h3>
                    <li>When you have a bad reaction to cannabis, you may begin to worry that something is severely wrong with you or that it may not end.</li>
                    <li>Try to remind yourself that these feelings are temporary and will likely disappear within a few hours.</li>

                    <h3>Sleep it off</h3>
                    <li>If you’re experiencing physical or psychological symptoms, sleep might be the best thing for you.</li>
                    <li>You’ll probably feel better when you wake up. Prepare to feel a bit tired and groggy, though.</li>
                    <li>Keep a glass of water handy, and place a bucket next to your bed if you’re feeling nauseous.</li>
                 
                    <h3>Stay hydrated</h3>
                    <li>Sip on water.</li>
                    <li>This is especially helpful if you’re experiencing cotton mouth, nausea, or headaches.</li>
                    <li>The repetitive sensation of sipping water may also help you feel a little calmer.</li>
                    <li>If you’ve been throwing up, an electrolyte drink might be helpful.</li>
            
                    <h3>Relax</h3>
                    <li>Overstimulation and stress can make you feel more on edge.</li>
                    <li>If you’re in a crowd or a noisy area, try to go somewhere quiet where you can relax and unwind — even if it’s just a bathroom or toilet stall.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, getting some fresh air on a balcony or in a garden might help soothe anxiety, nausea, and racing thoughts.</li>
                    
                    <h3>Use heat</h3>
                    <li>If you’re experiencing the symptoms of CHS, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, heat might be helpful.</li>
                    <li>Although there are currently no formal treatments for CHS, a 2022 review suggested that some people with CHS can frequently take hot baths and showers.</li>
                    <li>This might bring them temporary relief, as can applying capsaicin cream to their stomachs.</li>
                    <li>A hot water bottle may also help.</li>
                    <li>Why heat? It seems that a peripheral tissue receptor interacts with the endocannabinoid system.</li>
                    <li>It is also the only known capsaicin receptor, and heat affects it.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="what-to-do">
                <h2>What To Do If You've Had Too Much Cannabis</h2>
                <p>While these symptoms usually don’t cause lasting health effects, there are a few cases when you may want to get medical care. 
                    Keep reading to learn more about what people can do to reduce the ‘high.’ Note that many of these tips are anecdotal or based 
                    on animal studies, which means they lack rigorous human research.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <h3>Shift the focus and relax</h3>
                    <li>Listening to some favorite music.</li>
                    <li>Watching a film or some funny clips online.</li>
                    <li>Doing some breathing exercises or yoga.</li>
                    <li>Doing a jigsaw, doodling, playing a computer game.</li>
                    <li>Playing an instrument or painting, doing something creative.</li>
                    <li>Being productive in a simple way, for example, organizing a wardrobe or doing some cleaning.</li>

                    <h3>Hydrate</h3>     
                    <li>Drinking plenty of water, tea, or other soft drinks to keep hydrated can also minimize discomfort from being too high.</li>
                    <li>Having a dry mouth (xerostomia) from smoking or ingesting marijuana can make a person feel worse.</li>
                    <li>The American Dental Association indicate a link between using marijuana and oral dryness.</li>
                    <li>A person should avoid drinking alcohol when they are already too high.</li>
                    <li>It can worsen the effects of weed and the ‘high feeling.’</li>
               
                    <h3>Eat</h3>
                    <li>There is some evidence that cannabis consumption can lead to increased hunger and appetite.</li>
                    <li>There are no scientific studies to support the anecdotal claim that eating will diminish the psychoactive effects of weed.</li>
                    <li>According to an article in the <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-get-unhigh#eat" target="_blank">British Journal of Pharmacology</a>, 
                        compounds called terpenoids found in some plant foods might have therapeutic properties that may serve as an antidote to a cannabis high.</li>
                         
                    <h3>Take a shower</h3>
                    <li>***PUT SOMETHING HERE!!!***</li>
                
                    <h3>Walk it off</h3>
