            <h1> Coping Tips: </h1>
            <h3> *Consuming too much cannabis is rarely a medical emergency, despite how uncomfortable you may feel. 
                Symptoms will subside as the effects wear off. In the meantime, these tips can help things feel more manageable: </h3>   
            <ul class="list">
                <li> Remember that it will pass </li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li> When you have a bad reaction to cannabis, you may begin to worry that something is severely wrong with you or that it may not end. </li>
                    <li> Try to remind yourself that these feelings are temporary and will likely disappear within a few hours. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Sleep it off </li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li> If you’re experiencing physical or psychological symptoms, sleep might be the best thing for you. </li>
                    <li> You’ll probably feel better when you wake up. Prepare to feel a bit tired and groggy, though. </li>
                    <li> Keep a glass of water handy, and place a bucket next to your bed if you’re feeling nauseous. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Stay hydrated </li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li> Sip on water. </li>
                    <li> This is especially helpful if you’re experiencing cotton mouth, nausea, or headaches. </li>
                    <li> The repetitive sensation of sipping water may also help you feel a little calmer. </li>
                    <li> If you’ve been throwing up, an electrolyte drink might be helpful. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Relax </li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li> Overstimulation and stress can make you feel more on edge. </li>
                    <li> If you’re in a crowd or a noisy area, try to go somewhere quiet where you can relax and unwind — even if it’s just a bathroom or toilet stall. </li>
                    <li> Alternatively, getting some fresh air on a balcony or in a garden might help soothe anxiety, nausea, and racing thoughts. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Use heat </li>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li> If you’re experiencing the symptoms of CHS, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, heat might be helpful. </li>
                    <li> Although there are currently no formal treatments for CHS, a 2022 review suggested that some people with CHS can frequently take hot baths and showers. </li>
                    <li> This might bring them temporary relief, as can applying capsaicin cream to their stomachs. </li>
                    <li> A hot water bottle may also help. </li>
                    <li> Why heat? It seems that a peripheral tissue receptor interacts with the endocannabinoid system. </li>
                    <li> It is also the only known capsaicin receptor, and heat affects it. </li>
