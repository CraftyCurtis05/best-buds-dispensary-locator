                <h2>Edibles</h2>
                    <p>Edibles are food products infused with cannabis extract. Edibles come in many forms, including baked goods, candies, gummies, chocolates, lozenges, and beverages.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul id="edible-pro-list">
                    <li>Better for patients with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, or for individuals who want to avoid smoking.</li>
                    <li>Come in an infinite array of options, so consumers can take edibles that appeal to their taste buds.</li>
                    <li>Can be bought or homemade.</li>

                    <li>A more discreet means of consumption.</li>
                    <li> According to a 2016 study, edibles have been anecdotally reported to assist with symptoms of conditions like muscle spasms, pain, nausea and vomiting, cancer, appetite stimulation, and epilepsy, as well as several psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul id="edible-con-list">
                    <li>Effects and benefits take longer to kick in.</li>
                    <li>Easy to consume too much, whether by miscalculating dosages or not waiting long enough before taking more.</li>
                    <li>Though rare, there is a risk of inducing psychosis when consuming too much.</li>
                    <li> Potential side effects associated with overconsumption, such as confusion, anxiety, panic, paranoia, hallucinations, delusions, increased blood pressure, faster heart rate, and nausea.</li>
                    <li>According to the same 2016 study, overconsumption of edibles has been linked to: cognitive and motor impairment, extreme sedation, agitation, anxiety, cardiac stress, and vomiting.</li>

                <h2>Flower</h2>
                    <p>Cannabis smoking is the inhalation of smoke or vapor released by heating the flowers, leaves, or extracts of cannabis and releasing the main psychoactive chemical, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is absorbed into the bloodstream via the lungs. Cannabis can be smoked in a variety of pipe-like implements made in different shapes and of different materials including hand pipes ("bowls"), water pipes ("bongs"), cigarettes ("joints"), or blunts.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul id="flower-pro-list">
                    <li>Rapid onset rate, which means that consumers will feel effects and benefit from cannabis almost immediately.</li>
                    <li>Easier to manage how much is being consumed.</li>
                    <li>Delivers higher bioavailability rates in comparison to other methods.</li>
                    <li>Effects fade more quickly (about 1-2 hours); overdoing it is more difficult and will wear off sooner and less intensely than with edibles.</li>
                    <li>Has a reduced risk of being eaten by pets and children since it does not look like a delicious treat.</li>
                    <li>Quick and convenient means of consumption.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul id="flower-con-list">
                    <li>May compromise respiratory function since some of the same chemicals found in cigarettes can be found in cannabis smoke.</li>
                    <li>Has a shorter duration in terms of experiencing effects and benefiting from compounds.</li>
                    <li>Compounds can be lost in side-stream smoke.</li>
                    <li>Similarly to edibles, and other means of consumption, smoking cannabis with a potency that is too high can lead to adverse effects such as anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Emits a noticeable smell.</li>

                <h2>Oil</h2>
                    <p>Hash oil or cannabis oil is an oleoresin obtained by the extraction of cannabis or hashish. It is a cannabis concentrate containing many of its resins and terpenes - in particular, tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and other cannabinoids. Hash oil is usually consumed by smoking, vaporizing or eating.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul id="oil-pro-list">
                    <li>Cannabis oil is one of the most commonly prescribed home treatments for inflammation, chronic pain, and sometimes even acute pain.</li>
                    <li>Cannabis oil contains a comound called cannabinoids, including THC. This compound attaches itself to brain cells that are responsible for controlling excitable nerves and inducing relaxation. In this way, it helps epilepsy patients control the intensity of their seizures, although it cannot treat them completely.</li>
                    <li>THC, a cannabinoid oil compound, slows the buildup of amyloid plaque. It does so by inhibiting the enzyme that makes this plaque. Amyloid plaque kills brain cells, which ultimately leads to Alzheimer’s disease. Although there is no known cure for this disease, cannabis oil is definitely helpful in maintaining healthy brain cell count for a longer period of time.</li>
                    <li>Cannabis oil can help in improving the health of the cardiovascular system by balancing out the unhealthy oils in the human body. In addition, this oil can scrape off excess cholesterol from the heart and the arteries. In addition, cannabis oil also stimulate antioxidant processes that keep the system healthy, by minimizing the buildup of free radicals.</li>
                    <li>Studies suggest that using cannabis oil can ease the pain symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The THC in this oil attaches itself to nerve receptors in order to relieve pain. There are other studies that suggest that THC can control the spasming of muscles.</li>
                    <li>The effects of consuming cannabis oil have been directly linked with improved eye health, along with a reduction of the symptoms of glaucoma. As they grow older, more and more people turn to cannabis oil to maintain their eye health, and prevent macular degeneration.</li>
                    <li>Along with aiding digestion, consuming cannabis oil can also treat an inflammation of the bowel. Many studies have directly linked a decrease in inflammation and inflammatory symptoms such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, with the consumption of cannabis oil. The chemicals in the cannabis oil, such as the THC and CBD, interact with the cells and boosts the body’s gut function and immune responses. The body produces compounds that increase the vulnerability of the intestinal wall to infections. The cannabinoids from the cannabis boil, can block these harmful compounds, and in turn strengthen the intestinal wall. In this way, it can decrease the gastrointestinal tract’s susceptibility to infections.</li>
                    <li>Cannabis has long been associated with feelings of relaxation and sedation. So it is no surprise that cannabis oil contains similar properties. It relaxes the mind and body by generating low-level energy and slowing the heart rate, and this enables us to rest.</li>
                    <li>Cannabis oil has been known to be especially beneficial to those who suffer from Parkinson’s disease. The cannabinoid compounds attach themselves to the nerve fibers and relax them. This reduces tremors, which is one of the most visible symptoms of Parkinson’s. Additional research has shown that this oil can also improve fine motor skills, although these results are uncorroborated.</li>
                    <li>Consuming cannabis oil can benefit patients of arthritis in many ways. It reduces inflammation, alleviates pain, and induces relaxation and sleep. A combination of these three benefits is what makes this oil so popular among rheumatoid arthritis patients.</li>
                    <li>There have only been early studies in this area, but reports state that the active components of cannabis oil can have preventative effects in the body by reducing the accumulation of free radicals in the body. In addition, it can also be used to treat tumors, according to the results. Cannabis oil reduces tumor size, according to these early reports.</li>
                    <li>Quite often, the effects of a stroke can extend to the brain. Studies have shown that compounds in cannabis oil may help in protecting the brain from the effects of a stroke. It reduces the size of the affected area, thus protecting quite a bit of brain function. Studies have thrown light on the neuroprotective effects of cannabis oil in other traumatic events, such as concussions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul id="oil-con-list">
                    <li>Using large amounts of cannabis oil can lead to several problems. It can irritate the lungs and increase the risk of developing chronic bronchitis, as well as respiratory cancers.</li>
                    <li>Studies show that excessive consumption can also lead to a decrease in brain function, including a lack of concentration, negative impacts on short-term memory, and reduced cognitive function.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, cannabis oil also reduces libido and dependence can also result in irregular menstrual cycles in females and lower sperm count in males.</li>

                <h2>Tincture</h2>
                    <p>A tincture in the most basic sense is a cannabis extract, in which a liquid is infused with cannabis, meant for sublingual consumption, not vaporization or smoking. The cannabis plant soaks in a base liquid, such as food-grade alcohol, glycerin, or even oil, and after days of steeping, the plant matter is strained out and—voilà! The cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds have melded with the base liquid, ready to dose and consume.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul id="tincture-pro-list">
                    <li>A measured dropper is often distributed with tinctures, allowing users to get precise doses.</li>
                    <li>Tincture is an edible, and compared to major product types, edibles do not require smoking or vaping and are thus a preferred way for many. And they are more discreet and do not require any tools and accessories.</li>
                    <li>Compared to other edibles, the main pros of tinctures are quick onset, and even the ability to choose how quickly you want it to act by adjusting your consumption method, as well as a much more inclusive and short list of ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Most tinctures are vegan, and do not contain sugar, fat, gluten, and so on. Most tinctures, unless flavored, are just a mix of MCT oil & cannabis.</li>
                    <li>Tinctures can come as pure THC, pure CBD, or a ratio of cannabinoids (anywhere from 1:1 to 30:1 and above), allowing consumers to tailor their experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul id="tincture-con-list">
                    <li> Because of their higher THC content, tinctures can run a bit higher in price. Some can run over $100 per bottle.</li>
                    <li>Most tinctures, unless flavored, have a very earthy taste that may not appeal to all consumers.</li>
                    <li>6-8 hours of effects can be too long for some users to commit to.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Display Topical Information -->
            <section class="topical">
                <h2>Topical</h2>
                    <p>THC topicals, and cannabis topicals in general, are cannabis products infused in things like gels, balms, and lotions and then applied to our skin. The idea behind them is that they may be able to treat acute symptoms, including pain or inflammation, by interacting with cannabinoid receptors in the skin. Because the THC doesn't actually make it through the skin into the bloodstream, THC topical enthusiasts don't have to worry about getting intoxicated when they use a cannabis topical.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul id="topical-pro-list">
                    <li>Cannabis topicals enter the bloodstream through cannabinoid receptors in the skin and offer fast-acting, localized relief. They’re a fantastic way to enjoy the therapeutic qualities of cannabis without the psychoactive effects.</li>
                    <li>While studies are ongoing, cannabis topicals appear to offer several potential benefits. They may be a promising alternative to traditional pain and inflammation treatments, help soothe skin conditions, and intensify sexual response when used in products such as lubricants.</li>
                    <li>Because they offer little to no psychoactive impact, there really aren’t any side effects associated with the use of cannabis topicals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul id="topical-con-list">
                    <li>These products would have to be more seriously studied to know for sure, but based on our own experience and the anecdotal evidence we’ve heard, there are no apparent downsides to THC topicals.</li>
                    <li>The only exception is for those who have seriously sensitive skin or an allergy to some other ingredient the topical contains.</li>
                    <li>If you’re afraid of experiencing a reaction, make sure to do a “patch test” before use.</li>
                    <li>Apply a little of the product to a few inches of skin and monitor for a reaction before you slather on a whole bottle.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="wax">
                <h2>Wax</h2>
                    <p>THC wax is a highly concentrated form of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main intoxicating substance found in cannabis. THC wax has 40-80 percent more THC per dose than more traditional, dried forms of cannabis. Different types of weed concentrate can have the texture of a: Sticky, gummy liquid; Soft, solid lip balm; Hard, dark-yellow solid resin.</p>
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul class="wax-pro-list">
                    <li>The effect is much cleaner and stronger than a joint or vaporizer.</li>
                    <li>Though dabbing is not typically used by medicinal cannabis users, it theoretically could be an effective route for acute symptoms because it is fast acting and effective.</li>
                    <li>Other inhalation methods would not deliver as high a dose of cannabinoids in a single inhalation.</li>
                    <li>The researchers concluded that there were no more problems or accidents from cannabis dabbing compared to smoking cannabis flowers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul class="wax-con-list">
                    <li>Some find dabbing scary because the act is reminiscent of smoking crack — the device is made out of glass and a blow torch is required to heat the nail. As a result, there are people who claim that it does not contribute to a positive image of cannabis.</li>
                    <li>The concentrate itself, however, can be a problem. Making a cannabis concentrate is a painstaking job which involves chemical solvents such as ethanol, alcohol, propane or butane. A pure concentrate devoid of residual solvents is difficult to achieve without the correct knowledge and expertise. This leads to a lot of people to YouTube-style self-tuition, which often ends in a contaminated product. If customers purchase professionally-made cannabis concentrates however, there are far fewer risks of residual solvent.</li>
                    <li>Another danger is overdosing. Although it is still not possible to die from a cannabis overdose, the effects can be very unpleasant if too large a dose is inhaled. Caution is therefore advised.</li>
                </ul>
