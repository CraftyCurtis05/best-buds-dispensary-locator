                                    <li> Fight back with cannabidiol (CBD) - an anxiety-fighting compound that comes handy when it comes to fighting pot jitters. </li>
                                    <li> Fight back with black pepper. Both pot and pepper affect the body’s endocannabinoid system. The phytocannabinoid-terpenoid effect not only kills anxiety, but it also helps with addiction, depression, as well as pain. </li>
                                    <li> Don’t panic! You can’t overdose (OD) and die on weed. What hospital Emergency Rooms (ERs) are reporting is increased panic attacks and anxiety reactions, not overdoses. No one is suffering systemic organ failures, or losing their lives because they ingested too much pot. </li>
                                    <li> Be smart on dosing. When starting out, limit yourself to only 10 milligrams of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and note how it affects you. If smoking it, you’ll know within a few minutes how high you’re going to get. If using edibles, wait at least an hour. </li>

                    <h4> *Cannabis comes in a variety of forms including edibles and concentrates but they are not the best choice for your first time. 
                        Extracts including vape cartridges are too potent and hard to handle for a novice and edibles are not that predictable in terms 
                        of dosage and effects (which depend on numerous factors like tolerance and the time of onset) the buzz may start hours from 
                        ingestion and last for up to 8 hours.

            <ul class="list">
                <li> What is the method of smoking cannabis? </li>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> The most common method of smoking cannabis is to use a pipe, bong, or joint. </li>
                        <li> A pipe is a small, handheld device with a bowl at one end and a mouthpiece at the other. </li>
                        <li> A bong is a larger device with a water chamber that cools the smoke before it is inhaled. </li>
                        <li> A joint is a rolled cigarette made of cannabis and tobacco. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li> How do you take a good hit? </li>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> To take a good hit, first grind the cannabis. </li>
                        <li> Then, pack the bowl of your pipe or bong with the ground cannabis. </li>
                        <li> Light the bowl and inhale slowly and deeply. </li>
                        <li> Hold the smoke in your lungs for just a few seconds before exhaling. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> There are a few things you can do to get higher when smoking cannabis. </li>
                        <li> First, use more potent strains. </li>
                        <li> Second, take bigger hits. </li>
                        <li> And third - do not hold in the smoke. </li>
                        <li> The THC is absorbed in the lungs almost instantaneously so holding the smoke will lead to absorbing stuff you do not need and can actually be harmful to your lungs. </li>

                <li> How to smoke cannabis the first time? </li>

                        <li> If you are smoking cannabis for the first time, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the amount you smoke. </li>
                        <li> This will help you avoid getting too high and feeling sick. </li>
                        <li> It is also important to be in a comfortable and relaxed setting when you first smoke cannabis. </li>

                <h4> *If you are new to smoking, it may be difficult to inhale the smoke properly. Here are a few tips: </h4>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> Start by taking small, shallow breaths. </li>
                        <li> Don't try to inhale too much smoke at once. </li>
                        <li> Hold the smoke in your lungs briefly before exhaling. </li>
                        <li> Practice inhaling and exhaling with a clean pipe or bong before you smoke cannabis. </li>
                    </ul>    
                <li> Does coughing get you higher? </li>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> Coughing does not get you higher. </li>
                        <li> In fact, it can actually make you feel less high. </li>
                        <li> When you cough, you are expelling the smoke from your lungs before it has a chance to be absorbed into your bloodstream. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li> Does breathing deeper get you higher? </li>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li> Breathing deeper will not get you higher, but it can help you to absorb the smoke more efficiently. </li>
                        <li>  When you breathe deeply, you are taking in more oxygen, which helps to carry the THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) into your bloodstream. </li>
