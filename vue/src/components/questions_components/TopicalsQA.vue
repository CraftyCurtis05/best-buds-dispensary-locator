                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Cannabis topicals are products infused with cannabinoids (like THC and CBD) that are applied directly to the skin.</li>
                    <li>They include creams, balms, lotions, and salves designed for localized relief.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Cannabis topicals interact with the cannabinoid receptors in the skin and underlying tissues.</li>
                    <li>They do not enter the bloodstream but instead affect the local area where they are applied, providing targeted relief for pain, inflammation, or skin conditions.</li>
