                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) is the primary psychoactive compound found in cannabis.</li>
                    <li>It is responsible for the “high” associated with cannabis use and interacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain and body.</li>

                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Delta-9-THC binds to cannabinoid receptors (mainly CB1 receptors) in the brain and nervous system.</li>
