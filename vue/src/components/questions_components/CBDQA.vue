                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants.</li>
                    <li>It is one of over 100 cannabinoids and is known for its potential therapeutic benefits without causing the "high" typically associated with THC.</li>
