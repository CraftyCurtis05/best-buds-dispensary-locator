                <li>What is smoking cannabis?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Smoking cannabis involves inhaling the smoke from burning cannabis flowers or concentrates.</li>
                    <li>This can be done using various methods, such as joints, blunts, pipes, or bongs.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>How does smoking cannabis affect the body?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>When smoked, cannabinoids like THC and CBD enter the bloodstream through the lungs, leading to effects such as relaxation, euphoria, altered perception, and increased appetite.</li>
                    <li>Smoking can also irritate the lungs and airways.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>How long do the effects of smoking cannabis last?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>The effects of smoking cannabis typically begin within minutes and can last from 1 to 3 hours, depending on the strain, dose, and individual tolerance.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Is smoking cannabis harmful to the lungs?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Smoking cannabis can irritate the lungs and airways, potentially leading to issues like bronchitis or chronic coughing.</li>
                    <li>It’s generally considered less harmful than smoking tobacco, but long-term use can still have adverse effects.</li>

                <li>What are the differences between smoking cannabis and using edibles?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Smoking cannabis provides faster onset of effects (within minutes) and allows for more control over dosage.</li>
                    <li>Edibles take longer to kick in (30 minutes to 2 hours) and often produce longer-lasting effects.</li>
                    <li>Edibles also involve a different metabolism process.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Can you get high from smoking cannabis?</li>
                <ul id="sub-list">
                    <li>Yes, smoking cannabis will typically result in psychoactive effects due to the presence of THC.</li>
                    <li>The high can include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and altered sensory perceptions.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>In fact, it can actually make you feel less high.</li>
                    <li>When you cough, you are expelling the smoke from your lungs before it has a chance to be absorbed into your bloodstream.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>When you breathe deeply, you are taking in more oxygen, which helps to carry the THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) into your bloodstream.</li>
                </ul>
