            <h1>Tincture</h1>
            <p>A tincture in the most basic sense is a cannabis extract, in which a liquid is infused with cannabis, meant for sublingual consumption, not vaporization or smoking. The cannabis plant soaks in a base liquid, such as food-grade alcohol, glycerin, or even oil, and after days of steeping, the plant matter is strained out and—voilà! The cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds have melded with the base liquid, ready to dose and consume.</p>

            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul id="tincture-pro">
                <li>A measured dropper is often distributed with tinctures, allowing users to get precise doses.</li>
                <li>Tincture is an edible, and compared to major product types, edibles do not require smoking or vaping and are thus a preferred way for many. And they are more discreet and do not require any tools and accessories.</li>
                <li>Compared to other edibles, the main pros of tinctures are quick onset, and even the ability to choose how quickly you want it to act by adjusting your consumption method, as well as a much more inclusive and short list of ingredients.</li>
                <li>Most tinctures are vegan, and do not contain sugar, fat, gluten, and so on. Most tinctures, unless flavored, are just a mix of MCT oil & cannabis.</li>
                <li>Tinctures can come as pure THC, pure CBD, or a ratio of cannabinoids (anywhere from 1:1 to 30:1 and above), allowing consumers to tailor their experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul id="tincture-con">
                <li> Because of their higher THC content, tinctures can run a bit higher in price. Some can run over $100 per bottle.</li>
                <li>Most tinctures, unless flavored, have a very earthy taste that may not appeal to all consumers.</li>
                <li>6-8 hours of effects can be too long for some users to commit to.</li>
            </ul>
