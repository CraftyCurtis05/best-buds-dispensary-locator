            <h1>Oil</h1>
            <p>Hash oil or cannabis oil is an oleoresin obtained by the extraction of cannabis or hashish. It is a cannabis concentrate containing many of its resins and terpenes - in particular, tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and other cannabinoids. Hash oil is usually consumed by smoking, vaporizing or eating.</p>

            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul id="oil-pro">
                <li>Cannabis oil is one of the most commonly prescribed home treatments for inflammation, chronic pain, and sometimes even acute pain.</li>
                <li>Cannabis oil contains a comound called cannabinoids, including THC. This compound attaches itself to brain cells that are responsible for controlling excitable nerves and inducing relaxation. In this way, it helps epilepsy patients control the intensity of their seizures, although it cannot treat them completely.</li>
                <li>THC, a cannabinoid oil compound, slows the buildup of amyloid plaque. It does so by inhibiting the enzyme that makes this plaque. Amyloid plaque kills brain cells, which ultimately leads to Alzheimer’s disease. Although there is no known cure for this disease, cannabis oil is definitely helpful in maintaining healthy brain cell count for a longer period of time.</li>
                <li>Cannabis oil can help in improving the health of the cardiovascular system by balancing out the unhealthy oils in the human body. In addition, this oil can scrape off excess cholesterol from the heart and the arteries. In addition, cannabis oil also stimulate antioxidant processes that keep the system healthy, by minimizing the buildup of free radicals.</li>
                <li>Studies suggest that using cannabis oil can ease the pain symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The THC in this oil attaches itself to nerve receptors in order to relieve pain. There are other studies that suggest that THC can control the spasming of muscles.</li>
                <li>The effects of consuming cannabis oil have been directly linked with improved eye health, along with a reduction of the symptoms of glaucoma. As they grow older, more and more people turn to cannabis oil to maintain their eye health, and prevent macular degeneration.</li>
                <li>Along with aiding digestion, consuming cannabis oil can also treat an inflammation of the bowel. Many studies have directly linked a decrease in inflammation and inflammatory symptoms such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, with the consumption of cannabis oil. The chemicals in the cannabis oil, such as the THC and CBD, interact with the cells and boosts the body’s gut function and immune responses. The body produces compounds that increase the vulnerability of the intestinal wall to infections. The cannabinoids from the cannabis boil, can block these harmful compounds, and in turn strengthen the intestinal wall. In this way, it can decrease the gastrointestinal tract’s susceptibility to infections.</li>
                <li>Cannabis has long been associated with feelings of relaxation and sedation. So it is no surprise that cannabis oil contains similar properties. It relaxes the mind and body by generating low-level energy and slowing the heart rate, and this enables us to rest.</li>
                <li>Cannabis oil has been known to be especially beneficial to those who suffer from Parkinson’s disease. The cannabinoid compounds attach themselves to the nerve fibers and relax them. This reduces tremors, which is one of the most visible symptoms of Parkinson’s. Additional research has shown that this oil can also improve fine motor skills, although these results are uncorroborated.</li>
                <li>Consuming cannabis oil can benefit patients of arthritis in many ways. It reduces inflammation, alleviates pain, and induces relaxation and sleep. A combination of these three benefits is what makes this oil so popular among rheumatoid arthritis patients.</li>
                <li>There have only been early studies in this area, but reports state that the active components of cannabis oil can have preventative effects in the body by reducing the accumulation of free radicals in the body. In addition, it can also be used to treat tumors, according to the results. Cannabis oil reduces tumor size, according to these early reports.</li>
                <li>Quite often, the effects of a stroke can extend to the brain. Studies have shown that compounds in cannabis oil may help in protecting the brain from the effects of a stroke. It reduces the size of the affected area, thus protecting quite a bit of brain function. Studies have thrown light on the neuroprotective effects of cannabis oil in other traumatic events, such as concussions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul id="oil-con">
                <li>Using large amounts of cannabis oil can lead to several problems. It can irritate the lungs and increase the risk of developing chronic bronchitis, as well as respiratory cancers.</li>
                <li>Studies show that excessive consumption can also lead to a decrease in brain function, including a lack of concentration, negative impacts on short-term memory, and reduced cognitive function.</li>
                <li>Additionally, cannabis oil also reduces libido and dependence can also result in irregular menstrual cycles in females and lower sperm count in males.</li>
