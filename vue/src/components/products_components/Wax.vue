            <h1>Wax</h1>
            <p>THC wax is a highly concentrated form of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main intoxicating substance found in cannabis. THC wax has 40-80 percent more THC per dose than more traditional, dried forms of cannabis. Different types of weed concentrate can have the texture of a: Sticky, gummy liquid; Soft, solid lip balm; Hard, dark-yellow solid resin.</p>
            
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul id="wax-pro">
                <li>The effect is much cleaner and stronger than a joint or vaporizer.</li>
                <li>Though dabbing is not typically used by medicinal cannabis users, it theoretically could be an effective route for acute symptoms because it is fast acting and effective.</li>
                <li>Other inhalation methods would not deliver as high a dose of cannabinoids in a single inhalation.</li>
                <li>The researchers concluded that there were no more problems or accidents from cannabis dabbing compared to smoking cannabis flowers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul id="wax-con">
                <li>Some find dabbing scary because the act is reminiscent of smoking crack â€” the device is made out of glass and a blow torch is required to heat the nail. As a result, there are people who claim that it does not contribute to a positive image of cannabis.</li>
                <li>The concentrate itself, however, can be a problem. Making a cannabis concentrate is a painstaking job which involves chemical solvents such as ethanol, alcohol, propane or butane. A pure concentrate devoid of residual solvents is difficult to achieve without the correct knowledge and expertise. This leads to a lot of people to YouTube-style self-tuition, which often ends in a contaminated product. If customers purchase professionally-made cannabis concentrates however, there are far fewer risks of residual solvent.</li>
                <li>Another danger is overdosing. Although it is still not possible to die from a cannabis overdose, the effects can be very unpleasant if too large a dose is inhaled. Caution is therefore advised.</li>
