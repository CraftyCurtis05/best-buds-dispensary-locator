            <h1>Topical</h1>
            <p>THC topicals, and cannabis topicals in general, are cannabis products infused in things like gels, balms, and lotions and then applied to our skin. The idea behind them is that they may be able to treat acute symptoms, including pain or inflammation, by interacting with cannabinoid receptors in the skin. Because the THC doesn't actually make it through the skin into the bloodstream, THC topical enthusiasts don't have to worry about getting intoxicated when they use a cannabis topical.</p>
            
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul id="topical-pro">
                <li>Cannabis topicals enter the bloodstream through cannabinoid receptors in the skin and offer fast-acting, localized relief. They’re a fantastic way to enjoy the therapeutic qualities of cannabis without the psychoactive effects.</li>
                <li>While studies are ongoing, cannabis topicals appear to offer several potential benefits. They may be a promising alternative to traditional pain and inflammation treatments, help soothe skin conditions, and intensify sexual response when used in products such as lubricants.</li>
                <li>Because they offer little to no psychoactive impact, there really aren’t any side effects associated with the use of cannabis topicals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul id="topical-con">
                <li>These products would have to be more seriously studied to know for sure, but based on our own experience and the anecdotal evidence we’ve heard, there are no apparent downsides to THC topicals.</li>
                <li>The only exception is for those who have seriously sensitive skin or an allergy to some other ingredient the topical contains.</li>
                <li>If you’re afraid of experiencing a reaction, make sure to do a “patch test” before use.</li>
                <li>Apply a little of the product to a few inches of skin and monitor for a reaction before you slather on a whole bottle.</li>
            </ul>
